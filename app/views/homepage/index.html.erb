      <p>"Rantly has allowed a certain freedom I never though possible. Now I can rant
        to the internet at large, without having to worry about my thoughts. I just type it
        out, hit click, and feel the surge of relief. Thanks Rantly, you've truly made my
        most inane rants heard. I remember a time when I wasn't able to truly express myslef. It's
        really frustrating when you want to be heard and non one..."
